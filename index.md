		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>We are a group of professionals that love California and are united by a set of common values and beliefs:
            <ul>
              <li> Public policy should not be outsourced to lobbyists or special interests.</li>
              <li> Technology can make a difference, but lines of code alone won’t solve problems. We take a holistic approach to challenges to tackle them from every angle.</li>
              <li> Dissent and discussion allow democracy to thrive and we want to listen to every community and hear all sides of the debate. </li>
            </ul>

				<span class="icon style2 major fa-home"></span>
				<a href="{{ site.url }}/housing"><h3>Housing</h3></a>
				<p>We believe that housing is a human right and every Californian should be able to afford to live in their own neighborhood. We've analyzed the legislative housing package working its way through Sacramento.</p>
