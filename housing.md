title: Housing 

---

California recently passed fifteen bills addressing the stateâ€™s housing crisis. This is a good first step toward improving access to housing for millions of Californians, but the housing crisis will not be solved in one legislative term. The Policy Club analyzed key parts of the housing package and produced estimates on what Californians can expect from these bills, as well as recommended additional steps to keep the momentum moving forward. 

**AB-827**: **Planning and zoning: transit-rich housing bonus**

With the potential to be the most impactful housing legislation since 1978's Prop 13, [here's our take on this proposed legislation](sb-827).

**AB-1568**: **Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District**

95% of parcels in Los Angeles County are eligible to become part of an Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District or EIFD. Should the entirety of the County vote to include all 2,274,361 eligible parcels in an EIFD, it would be possible to raise more than $6 trillion dollars over 20 years for the funding of affordable housing, but this situation is highly unlikely. We expect EIFDs in Los Angeles County to raise an estimated $134 million in FY 2018-19. It is uncertain how many EIFDs will be set up in the State of California, but we encourage local jurisdictions to explore this option as a means of securing a stable funding source for affordable housing production. Additionally, we encourage the state and advocacy organizations to publish toolkits and materials advocating for the creation of the EIFDs, along with potential boundaries, etc. An open dataset containing if each parcel is EIFD eligible for the entire state would go a long way towards meeting these goals. 

**SB-3: Affordable Housing Bond Act of 2018**

A $3 billion bond, if used exclusively to build units of housing, will build an estimated 9,523 units of affordable housing at an estimated cost of $315,000 per unit. We analyzed the average cost of building an affordable housing unit and found major differences in where the unit is built. The estimated cost of building a unit of affordable housing in Fresno, CA is less than $200,000, while a similar unit in San Francisco, CA will cost more than $400,000. 

**SB-35: Streamlined Approval Process**

Cities that do meet state housing goals will be subject to streamlined development, if projects meet a set of objective criteria, including affordability, density, zoning, historic, and environmental standards. All cities will be required to report their annual housing production to the California Department of Housing and Community Development. 

**Recommendations**

1. We encourage the development of a standardized rent reporting registry with the goal of developing real-time costs of housing in every zip code in California.

2. We recommend standardized data collection of new construction and regular reporting of revenue collected and expenditures from all Enhanced Infrastructure Financing Districts, as well as for every county in California.

3. We support the free and open sharing of public parcel files so that communities can determine the boundaries of an Enhanced Infrastructure Financing District.

4. We recommend the development of a consolidated database of all zoning areas by zip code in California.

5. We encourage new legislation to remove parking minimums for affordable housing through incentives or changes in existing law.

6. We request that all required reporting of housing production, changes in zoning, or other related information or data be made available online in a machine-readable format.
